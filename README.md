GhanaPay is a rapidly growing fintech company in Ghana, providing mobile money services, digital payments,
and micro-lending solutions. Over the past three years, they have accumulated a significant amount of
transaction data. The company is looking to hire a Data Analyst to help them gain valuable insights from this
data to improve customer experience, identify growth opportunities, and mitigate potential risks. 
Objective: Analyze the provided sample transaction data to identify key trends, customer behavior patterns,
and potential areas for improvement. 

## Key business problems identified from the GhanaPay transaction dataset:
 
1. Problem: Customers with fewer than 3 transactions show low engagement.

  Recommendations:
  * Launch onboarding campaigns with tutorials and welcome offers.
  * Introduce loyalty programs or incentives for repeat usage.
  * Use SMS or email reminders to re-engage dormant users.
 
2. Low Success Rate Customers
Problem: Some customers experience frequent transaction failures.

Recommendations:
* Conduct user experience surveys to identify pain points.
* Improve error handling and retry mechanisms in the app and USSD.
* Provide dedicated support for affected users to resolve issues quickly.

 
3. Potential Fraud Indicators
Problem: Unusually high-value transactions may indicate fraud or misuse.

Recommendations:
* Implement automated fraud detection systems using transaction thresholds and behavioral patterns.
* Set transaction limits based on customer profiles.
* Require additional verification for high-value transactions.

 
4. Device Failure Rates
Problem: USSD users have the highest failure rate.

Recommendations:
* Optimize USSD menu design for simplicity and speed.
* Collaborate with telecom providers to improve network reliability.
* Encourage users with smartphones to switch to the mobile app for better performance.

 
5. Location Failure Rates
Problem: Sunyani and Ho show higher failure rates than other regions.

Recommendations:
* Investigate network and infrastructure issues in high-failure regions.
* Deploy regional support teams or agents to assist users.
* Use geo-targeted alerts to inform users of known service disruptions.
